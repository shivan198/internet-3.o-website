                <p id="headp"><strong>INTERNET</strong></p>
                <p id="conp">The Internet is that the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the net protocol suite (TCP/IP) to speak between networks and devices. it's a network of networks that consists of personal, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. the net carries an enormous range of knowledge resources and services, like the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the globe Wide Web (WWW), electronic message, telephony, and file sharing.</p>
                <p id="conp">
                The origins of the net start to the event of packet switching and research commissioned by the us Department of Defense within the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. the first precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks within the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a replacement backbone within the 1980s, additionally as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation within the development of latest networking technologies, and therefore the merger of the many networks. The linking of business networks and enterprises by the first 1990s marked the start of the transition to the fashionable Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the net was widely employed by academia within the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of recent life.

                <p id="conp">
                The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly referred to as the online, is an system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, like https://example.com/), which can be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the net.The resources of the online are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and should be accessed by users by a software application called an internet browser and are published by a software application called an online server. the planet Wide Web isn't synonymous with the net, which pre-existed the online in some form by over twenty years and upon whose technologies the net is constructed.

                English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the globe Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the primary application program in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, so to the overall public in August 1991. the globe Wide Web has been central to the event of the knowledge Age, and is that the primary tool billions of individuals use to interact on the web.

                <p id="conp">
                The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred formally as World Wide Web (www) is a collection of information that is accessed via the Internet. Another way to look at this difference is, the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is served on top of that infrastructure.
